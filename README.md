## Project Description
 * Why is it important or interesting to you? As music lovers, we love listening to music when we do our homework or want to have a fun time. However, sometimes we often run out of songs to listen to or want to discover some new music. That brings us to why we wanted to create Melody Match, the solution to our musical problem. 
 * What languages/tools/technologies do you plan to use? (This list may change over the course of the project) We plan to use C++, as it is the language we are the most knowledgeable about; GoogleTest, so we can have a testing suite to make sure our code works; Git, so we have a platform onto which we can update our project code files and utilize its Kanban Board; VSCode, which we will write our code in; and Spotify Web API, which has music resources we can develop and implement in our project to create necessary features.
 * What will be the input/output of your project? We will have a terminal-based output for our project to display on, and in this terminal, the user will be able to enter their favorite song and genres. They can also enter their mood. After this, the user could get an output for a list of potential songs that interest them and find new songs for them. Another input that the user could provide would be what songs they want to put in a playlist. The output could have all the songs in the playlist sorted.
 * What are the features that the project provides? The project will be able to provide a song based on various user input, such as mood, genre, or favorite song. The project then outputs a list of potential songs that could interest the user based on a recommendation algorithm. The list of songs is able to be sorted based on dates, alphabetical order, and other factors.

## Phase III
You will need to schedule a check-in for the second scrum meeting with the same reader you had your first scrum meeting with (using Calendly). Your entire team must be present. This meeting will occur on Zoom and should be conducted by Wednesday of week 8.
 
BEFORE the meeting you should do the following:
  * Update your class diagram from Phase II to include any feedback you received from your TA/grader.
  * Considering the SOLID design principles, reflect back on your class diagram and think about how you can use the SOLID principles to improve your design. You should then update the README.md file by adding the following:
    * A new class diagram incorporating your changes after considering the SOLID principles.
    * For each update in your class diagram, you must explain in 3-4 sentences:
      * What SOLID principle(s) did you apply?
      * How did you apply it? i.e. describe the change.
      * How did this change help you write better code?
  * Perform a new sprint plan like you did in Phase II.
  * You should also make sure that your README file (and Project board) are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project and the most recent class diagram. Previous versions of the README file should still be visible through your commit history.
 
 During the meeting with your reader you will discuss: 
  * How effective your last sprint was (each member should talk about what they did)
  * Any tasks that did not get completed last sprint, and how you took them into consideration for this sprint
  * Any bugs you've identified and created issues for during the sprint. Do you plan on fixing them in the next sprint or are they lower priority?
  * What tasks you are planning for this next sprint.

 
 ## Final deliverable
  All group members will give a demo to the reader during lab time. ou should schedule your demo on Calendly with the same reader who took your second scrum meeting. The reader will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
  Before the demo, you should do the following:
  * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
  * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Project board.
  * Make sure your README file and Project board are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project (e.g. any changes that you have made during the project such as changes to your class diagram). Previous versions should still be visible through your commit history.

 ## Testing
  How was your project tested/validated? If you used CI, you should have a "build passing" badge in this README.
